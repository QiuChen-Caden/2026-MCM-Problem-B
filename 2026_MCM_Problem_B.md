## Background

Imagine a future where it’s possible for anyone to visit space by taking a leisurely and scenic ride from the Equator to Earth’s orbit and then catching a routine, safe, and inexpensive rocket flight to the Moon, Mars, or beyond. In this future, we could build lush, green, and beautiful space habitats with artificial gravity, where people would vacation, work, or even live. These habitats would alleviate pressure on Earth’s delicate, overworked, and fragile ecosystems.

Some people envision a **Space Elevator System**—powered by electricity—as the enabling infrastructure, offering scalable logistics for interplanetary commerce and exploration.

## Space Elevator System (Final Operating Configuration)

At full build-out, the Space Elevator System comprises:

- **Three Galactic Harbours**, ideally separated by **120° around the equator**.
- Each **Galactic Harbour** includes:
  - **One Earth Port**
  - **Two 100,000 km-long tethers**
  - **Two apex anchors** (each tether connects the Earth port to an apex anchor)
- Multiple space elevators operating together, each capable of lifting massive payloads daily from Earth to **GEO** and beyond to the **apex anchor**, where payloads can be loaded onto a rocket.

## Moon Colony Plan (MCM Agency)

The Moon Colony Management (MCM) Agency plans to build a **Moon Colony for ~100,000 people**, beginning in **2050**, after completion of the Space Elevator System.

Key estimates:

| Item | Value |
|---|---:|
| Colony population capacity | 100,000 people |
| Start year | 2050 |
| Total construction materials required | 100,000,000 metric tons |
| Annual lift capacity (Galactic Harbour system) | 179,000 metric tons / year |
| Atmospheric pollution from elevator lift | None (electric lift system) |

Once complete, the colony must also receive routine shipments of **water and supplies** to sustain the population.

## Transportation Options

### A) Two-step route via Galactic Harbour + Rocket
To reach the Moon, cargo moves in **two steps**:

1. **Earth Port → Apex Anchor** via space elevator  
2. **Apex Anchor → Moon Colony** via rocket

### B) Traditional rockets (single step)
Traditional rockets transport cargo in **one step**:

- **Earth rocket launch site → Moon Colony**

By 2050, rockets are estimated to carry **100–150 metric tons** of payload to the Moon using advanced Falcon Heavy launches.

## Existing Rocket Launch Sites (Modern Earth)

There are **ten** rocket launch sites:

1. Alaska (United States)  
2. California (United States)  
3. Texas (United States)  
4. Florida (United States)  
5. Virginia (United States)  
6. Kazakhstan  
7. French Guiana  
8. Satish Dhawan Space Centre (India)  
9. Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center (China)  
10. Mahia Peninsula (New Zealand)

## Modeling Assumptions (Allowed)

You may assume **perfect conditions** for both systems, e.g.:

- No tether swaying  
- No failed rocket launches  
- (Unless you are analyzing non-perfect working order in Task #2)

You should consider **cost and timeline** to deliver materials from Earth’s surface to the Moon Colony site under different scenarios.

---

## Your Task (Deliverables to Model & Compare)

Build a mathematical model to determine the **cost** and **timeline** to transport material to build the Moon Colony starting in 2050. Compare:

- The Space Elevator System’s **three Galactic Harbours** vs.
- Traditional rockets launched from selected rocket bases

Your model should include:

1. **Three delivery scenarios** for the *100 million metric tons* of materials:
   - (a) Space Elevator System alone  
   - (b) Traditional rockets alone (you may choose which bases to use)  
   - (c) A combination of both methods  

2. **Sensitivity to non-perfect operations**  
   - How do solutions change if systems are not in perfect working order?  
     (e.g., tether swaying, rocket failures, elevator breakdowns)

3. **Water needs for one year (operational phase)**  
   - Investigate water requirements for **one year** once the **100,000-person** colony is fully operational  
   - Use your delivery model to estimate additional **cost** and **timeline** to ensure sufficient water for one full year after habitation

4. **Environmental impact**  
   - Discuss impacts on Earth’s environment for achieving the colony under different scenarios  
   - Explain how you would adjust the model to **minimize environmental impact**

5. **Recommendation letter (1 page)**  
   - Write a one-page letter recommending a course of action to the fictional MCM Agency
